    <p>
      Arimo was designed by Steve Matteson as an innovative, refreshing sans serif
      design that is metrically compatible with Arial. Arimo offers improved
      on-screen readability characteristics and the pan-European WGL character set
      and solves the needs of developers looking for width-compatible fonts to
      address document portability across platforms.
